# University-Aid-Management-Website
Developed a full-stack web app to streamline university financial aid processing. Built dynamic, responsive front-end with JavaScript, integrated SQL for secure data handling, and optimized CRUD operations. Designed logic to track applications, generate reports, and maintain data integrity via relational constraints.

All the required code for this project is in the project.zip file.

To run the project, start by opening login.html under the public folder, which serves as the entry point to the website and allows navigation to all other pages from there.
